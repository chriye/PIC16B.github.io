**Overall, what did you achieve in your project?**
In the project, There are a few things that we achieved in this project. We create a model that predicts uploaded dog breeds with 91% accuracy. Successfully get 120 dog breeds information from the Dogtime website. Besides that, we are able to detect if uploaded images are a person, recommend dog breeds based on users ranking on dogs' characteristics. Furthermore, we build a super cool website that has a beautiful background and nice looking format, which gives users a great experience when users using our web app.


**What are two aspects of your project that you are especially proud of?**
    - After a few tries on creating a model, we finally create a model using the Functional API and tensor flow. Even though it's a bit overfitting(like 7%), the accuracy is about 91%. The reason why we use this one is that we upload a dog image to predict, and the result is the best performance among others.

    - We spent lots of time building our web app and polishing it. Compare to our original web app, we add lots of details and ideas to creating an outstanding website. On the find your dog website, we use a penguin to rank on each characteristic. On our background, we add techniques to make it has motion instead of a static image. And also, we choose a font family to make it looks more formal.


**What are two things you would suggest doing to further improve your project? (You are not responsible for doing those things.)**
    - We can also add more applications to our web app. One thing is that we can allow users to log in and keep track of their dog's health, and diet. Or we can create a model that identifies whether the dog is sad or sick. The reason to build it is that may help beginners to better take care of their dogs.

    - Another thing is we may work more on our model to get better performance. In fact, we may get a higher accuracy using Functional API and TensorFlow.


**How does what you achieved compare to what you set out to do in your proposal? (if you didn't complete everything in your proposal, that's fine!)**

In our proposal, our main goal is just to build a web app that can identify dog breeds. But in our final project, we add more applications like recommend dog breeds for you, users can look up the dog breed information, and users can use two methods to upload images for identification. To compare to our proposal, we're really satisfied with our final project.

**What are three things you learned from the experience of completing your project? Data analysis techniques? Python packages? Git + GitHub? Etc?**

    - Using scrapying to get dog breed information, we're getting more proficient in getting data that we want from the website by using scrapying.

    -  TensorFlow is a great open source for deep machine learning. For example, we may use their Transfer learning and fine-tuning method to build a model, which may help us get a better prediction on our data.

    - Building a web app for our project, we get familiar with how things work. For instance, we self-learn some HTML syntax, use CSS to stylish our web app. 


**How will your experience completing this project will help you in your future studies or career? Please be as specific as possible.**

Throughout this project, we learn lots of useful skills, which may help in our future careers. For example, we are familiar with using Github, which allows us to share code with others and to collaborate with colleges to work on a project. Besides that, we know how to use Tensorflow to modify data, create a model using a pre-trained model that gives a great performance to identify from dogs, people, etc. Moreover, we learn how to build our own web app and polish it.
