In this blog post, weâ€™ll create several interesting, interactive data graphics using the NOAA climate data.

## 1. Create a Database

We want to create a connection database to store three databases.

To better do analysis in data, we need to use **sqlite3** and **pandas** packages. The **sqlite3** package allows us to access more convenient functions to analyze our data.

```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd
```

In case the specified database does not exist, instantiating the connection will also create an empty database with the specified name.

`conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")`

In order to make the data much more readible, we write a *prepare_df* function to clean up our data set.

```python
def prepare_df(df):
    """
    input  : a data
    output : a data with some changes
    
    Group the data in the certain format, modify conlumns' names and some columns' data.
    """
    df = df.set_index(keys=["ID", "Year"]) # group the data by their ID and the year
    df = df.stack()
    df = df.reset_index() # modify the format
    df = df.rename(columns = {"level_2"  : "Month" , 0 : "Temp"}) # rename the columns
    df["Month"] = df["Month"].str[5:].astype(int) # modify the Month data
    df["Temp"]  = df["Temp"] / 100 # modify the Temp data
    return(df)
```

Like we nomally do, we need to read the data and store it. But the only diference here is that we need a parameter **chunksize** here, which **read_csv** will return an iterator not a data frame by pieces. 

After this, we use a for loop to do the clean up and put it into the connection database. Here, we use the **df.to_sql** function to put each pieces of cleaned data into the conn database. The first parameter of **df.to_sql** is a name of the object putted in a connection. The second parameter is a name of the connection databas. **if_exists == "append"** means append the elements on the object instead of overwritten it.


```python
df_iter = pd.read_csv("temps.csv", chunksize = 100000)

for df in df_iter:
    df = prepare_df(df) # clean up data
    df.to_sql("temperatures", conn, if_exists = "append", index = False) # save it into the connection database
```

Read the **"station-metadata.csv"** and also put it into the conn database. But **if_exist = "replace"** because we want to overwritten on it.

```python
stations = pd.read_csv("station-metadata.csv")
stations.to_sql("stations", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
```

Read the **"countries.csv"** and also put it into the conn database.

```python
countries = pd.read_csv("countries.csv")
#since there're spaces on the first two columns' names, we renamed them.
countries = countries.rename(columns = {"FIPS 10-4": "cb1", "ISO 3166": "cb2"})
countries.to_sql("countries", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
```

Here, we want to make sure that the conn database has three seperately tables('temperatures', 'stations', 'countries').

In order to check that, we need to talk about **cursor**.
The **cursor** is our primary way to interact with the database. And the **cursor.execute** is actually its own mini-programming language specifically designed for interacting with database. 

To better understand how cursor commands execute, we break the command 
"""SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'""" into pieces and give explantion.

- **SELECT name**: Show the entries in the *name* column
- **FROM sqlite_master**: From *sqlite_master* table
- **WHERE type='table'**: The condition is table type

*sqlite_master* contains information on all the objects in the database.


```python
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'")
print(cursor.fetchall())
```

After finishing accessing the conn database, we close it up.

`conn.close()`

## 2. Write a Query Function

Here we'll write a *query_climate_database* function. Given a specific country, year_begin, year_end, and month to output data that in the specific country with the specific month between the start year and the end year.

For multiple SQL queries command lines, we use **cmd = \\"""command goes here"""** instead. First, we join the stations table to the temperatures table by *ID* column. Next, join the countries table by abbreviations for countries. Then we use **SELECT.. FROM... WHERE** to write out the condition. 

For convenience, we give abbreviations for database. In the cmd of the *query_climate_database* function, T stands for temperatures, S stands for stations, etc. S.name refers to 'name' column from the S table.


One more thing should be noticed is that we'll use **pd.read_sql_query( )** to print the output. The first parameter here is the cmd(command lines). The second command is the database that we want to access when cmd is executed.


```python
def query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month):
    """
    input: country(string), year_begin(int), year_end(int), month(int)
    output: data that meet the required conditions
    
    Joint three database, select the data that in the specific country, month between the start year and the end year
    """
    
    # connect to the database first
    conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")
    # SQL command(select the data)
    cmd = \
    """
    SELECT S.name, S.latitude, S.longitude, C.name, T.year, T.month, T.temp
    FROM temperatures T

    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON C.cb1 = SUBSTRING (T.id, 1, 2)

    WHERE (T.year>={0} AND T.year<={1}) AND T.month={2} AND C.name='{3}'
    """.format(year_begin, year_end, month, country)
    
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    
    conn.close()
    return df
```

## 3. Write a Geographic Scatter Function for Yearly Temperature Increases

Yeah. You made it!! Next step is super cool. We'll make some geographic visualization. Our goal here is answer that how does the average yearly change in temperature vary within a given country via geographic viasualization.

We break down the section into pieces first. First step we need is to write a function that select the data that we want, which we need in the last section. Next, we need to write a *temperature_coefficient_plot* function that deeper select the data and made geographic plot of it.

The next code block, we'll write a *coef* function to compute the coefficient to predict how temperatures yearly change.


```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def coef(data_group):
    """
    input: data frame
    output: data frame of coefficients
    
    Compute the coefficients of how temperatures changed yearly in a country
    """
    x = data_group[["Year"]] # 2 brackets because X should be a df
    y = data_group["Temp"]   # 1 bracket because y should be a series
    LR = LinearRegression()
    LR.fit(x, y)
    return LR.coef_[0].round(4)
```

In the *temperature_coefficient_plot* function, we want it to use geographic plot to show how temperatures changed yearly in a country.

Notation: 

- Use **br** with **<** on the left and **>** on the right to breaks a line in a string
- Use *str.format( )* to pass values into string


```python
import calendar #get a month name by an integer
import plotly.io as pio # save figures
from plotly.io import write_html

def temperature_coefficient_plot(country, year_begin, year_end, 
                                 month, min_obs, **kwargs):
    """ 
    input: country, year_begin, year_end, month are the same variables used in query_climate_database.
           min_obs is each station must have at least min_obs years' observations to be shown on the plot.
           **kwargs is for parameters of plot.
    output: a plot that shows stations in a country with its coefficient of how temperatures changed yearly
    
    Filter the qualified data and made a geographic plot
    """
    # use query_climate_database to filter the qualified data
    db1 = query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month)
    # select stations that has at least min_obs year data
    db2 = db1.loc[db1.groupby(["NAME"])["Year"].transform(len) >= min_obs]
    # group the station name and compute coefficient between temperatures and year
    coefs = db2.groupby(["NAME"]).apply(coef)
    coefs = coefs.reset_index()
    # merge the db2 and coefs database by the "NAME" column
    db3 = pd.merge(db2, coefs, on = ["NAME"])
    # rename the coefficient column
    db3 = db3.rename(columns = {0 : "Estimated Yearly Increase(\N{DEGREE SIGN}C)"}) # rename
    # make the plot
    fig = px.scatter_mapbox(
                        db3, # database
                        lat = "LATITUDE", # latitude to draw the dot
                        lon = "LONGITUDE", # longitude
                        hover_name = "NAME", # station names shown where mouse hovers overhead
                        zoom = 2, # map zoom level
                        height = 300, # size of map
                        width = 500,
                        color = "Estimated Yearly Increase(\N{DEGREE SIGN}C)", # color of each dot
                        color_continuous_midpoint = 0, # center of the color bar is mactch to 0 coefficent
                        mapbox_style = "carto-positron",
                        title = "Estimates of yearly increase in temperature in " 
                        + "{0} <br>for stations in {1}, years {2} - {3}".format(
                            calendar.month_name[month], country, year_begin, year_end),
                        **kwargs # extra argument made by user
                        )
    
    # edit the title of the color bar
    fig.layout.coloraxis.colorbar.title = 'Estimated Yearly <br>Increase(\N{DEGREE SIGN}C)'
    # spaces around the plot
    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":50,"t":50,"l":0,"b":0})
    # show the figure
    fig.show()
    
    # save the plot
    write_html(fig, "plot_1.html")
```

The **plotly** package enables us to construct engaging interactive graphics. Here, we start up with a geographic plot to explore plotly's capabilities.

First, import the **plotly.express** package.

```python
import plotly.express as px

color_map = px.colors.diverging.RdGy_r # choose a colormap

temperature_coefficient_plot("India", 1980, 2020, 1, 10, 
                             color_continuous_scale = color_map)
```

## 4. Create Two More Interesting Figures

In PIC 16A, we learned made figures using matplotlib. After a warm up exercise on a plotly package, we should explore more other types.

### Box plot of temperatures on nearby stations 
Question:
How does average temperatures of nearby stations spread out in certain months?

To answer the question, first we need to write a function to filter the data. Then we write a function to made the plot.

We write a *near_station_data* function to collect the data.


```python
def near_station_data(country, year_begin, year_end, 
                      min_lat, max_lat, min_lon, max_lon,
                      month_start, month_end):
    """
    input: country(string), year_begin(int), year_end(int), month(int)
           min_lat, max_lat, min_lon, max_lon are the area selected to analyze
           month_start, month_end are the month range
    output: data that meet the required conditions
    
    Joint three databases, select the data that in the specific country, area between the start year and the end year
    """
    
    # connect to the database first
    conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")
    # SQL command(select the data)
    cmd = \
    """
    SELECT S.name, S.latitude, S.longitude, C.name, T.year, T.month, T.temp
    FROM temperatures T

    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON C.cb1 = SUBSTRING (T.id, 1, 2)

    WHERE (T.year>={0} AND T.year<={1}) AND (S.latitude>={2} AND S.latitude<={3})
    AND (S.longitude>={4} AND S.longitude<={5}) AND C.name = '{6}' AND (T.month>={7} AND T.month<={8})
    """.format(year_begin, year_end, min_lat, max_lat, min_lon, max_lon, country, month_start, month_end)
    
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    
    conn.close()
    
    return df
```

Then we write a *near_station_temp_plot* function to made the plot.

```python
def near_station_temp_plot(country, year_begin, year_end, 
                           min_lat, max_lat, min_lon, max_lon,
                           month_start, month_end,
                           **kwargs):
    """ 
    input: country, year_begin, year_end, month are the same variables used in query_climate_database.
           min_lat, max_lat, min_lon, max_lon are the as above definition
           **kwargs is for parameters of plot.
    output: a plot shows how temperatures of stations in a specific area spread out over the year in a country 
    
    Filter the qualified data and made a box plot
    """
    # use near_station_data to filter the qualified data
    db1 = near_station_data(country, year_begin, year_end, 
                      min_lat, max_lat, min_lon, max_lon, month_start, month_end)
    # make the plot
    fig = px.box(
                db1, # database
                x = "Month", # x-axis
                y = "Temp", # y-axis
                height = 400, # size of map
                width = 800,
                color = "NAME",
                facet_col = "NAME", # seperate a plot into multiples x-axis by NAME column
                title = 
                    "Boxplot of each month temperature of stations<br>" + 
                    "where latitude({0}, {1}) and longitude({2}, {3})<br>".format(min_lat, max_lat, min_lon, max_lon) +
                    "from {0} - {1} in years {2} - {3} in {4}".format(calendar.month_name[month_start], calendar.month_name[month_end], year_begin, year_end, country),
                **kwargs # extra argument made by user
                )
    
    # spaces around the plot
    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":50,"t":150,"l":0,"b":0})
    # show the figure
    fig.show()
    
    # save the plot
    write_html(fig, "plot_2.html")
```

Give an example of what the plot will be like.

`near_station_temp_plot("India", 1980, 1990, 10.20, 11.25, 75.50, 77.50, 4,6)`

{% include plot_2.html %}

### Scatter mapbox of a selected area in a specific month 

Our question for this one is what's average temperature be like in a specific area in a specific month?

Like we previously did, we write a *selected_area_data* function to collect the data, and then write a *selected_area_plot* function to made the plot.

```python
def selected_area_data(year_begin, year_end, month,
                      min_lat, max_lat, min_lon, max_lon):
    """
    input: year_begin(int), year_end(int) are the year range
           month is the specific month
           min_lat, max_lat, min_lon, max_lon are the area selected to analyze
    output: data that meet the required conditions
    
    Joint three databases, select the data with selected area between the start year and the end year
    """
    
    # connect to the database first
    conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")
    # SQL command(select the data)
    cmd = \
    """
    SELECT S.name, S.latitude, S.longitude, C.name, T.year, T.month, T.temp
    FROM temperatures T

    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON C.cb1 = SUBSTRING (T.id, 1, 2)

    WHERE (T.year>={0} AND T.year<={1}) AND (S.latitude>={2} AND S.latitude<={3})
    AND (S.longitude>={4} AND S.longitude<={5} AND T.month={6})
    """.format(year_begin, year_end, min_lat, max_lat, min_lon, max_lon, month)
    
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    
    conn.close()
    
    return df
```

Now, we're ready to made the plot!!

```python
def selected_area_plot(year_begin, year_end, month,
                       min_lat, max_lat, min_lon, max_lon,
                       **kwargs):
    """ 
    input: year_begin(int), year_end(int) are the year range
           month is the specific month
           min_lat, max_lat, min_lon, max_lon are the area selected to analyze
           **kwargs is for parameters of plot.
    output: a plot shows the average temperatures in a specific area over a year range
    
    Filter the qualified data and made a heatmap plot
    """
    # use near_station_data to filter the qualified data
    db1 = selected_area_data(year_begin, year_end, month,
                             min_lat, max_lat, min_lon, max_lon)
    # filter the data and compute the average of temp by Month, NAME
    db2 = db1.groupby(["NAME", "Month"])["Temp"].mean()
    db2 = db2.reset_index()
    db3 = db2.rename(columns = {"Temp": "Ave_temp"}) # rename
    # combine the data by NAME
    db4 = pd.merge(db1, db3, on = ["NAME"])
    # make the plot
    fig = px.scatter_mapbox(
            db4, # database
            lat = "LATITUDE", # latitude
            lon = "LONGITUDE", # longitude
            hover_name = "NAME", 
            color = "Ave_temp",
            zoom = 1,
            opacity = 0.2, # transparent
            height = 400,
            mapbox_style = "carto-positron",
            title = 
                "Plot of average temperature of stations<br>" + 
                "where latitude({0}, {1}) and longitude({2}, {3})<br>".format(min_lat, max_lat, min_lon, max_lon) +
                "in {0} from years {1} - {2} ".format(calendar.month_name[month], year_begin, year_end),
            **kwargs
    )
    # spaces around the plot
    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":50,"t":100,"l":0,"b":0})
    # show the figure
    fig.show()
    
    # save the plot
    write_html(fig, "plot_3.html")
```

Here's an example of the *selected_area_plot* function's output should be like.

`selected_area_plot(1980, 2020, 12, -60, 60, 0, 180)`
