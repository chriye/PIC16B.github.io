Flask module is a web framework that enable us to develop web applications easily.

# Overview

In this blog post, we'll learn how to creat a simple webapp using Flask. 

The webapp that we'll create can submit information, and also can get the information.

The simple layout for the webapp will be there're two links that we can go to, which are 'Submit' and 'View'. Once we click the 'Submit', we could input a message and a name/handle. If we click the submit button, the infomation will be saved. In additon, we able to review the information when we click the 'View' button.


# Steps

## 1. Set up

#### - Install Flask

Go to the Environments, and choose an environment that you want to work on. On the environment page, search for 'flask' module and download it.

#### - Create a __init__.py file

Before we do anything fancy, we need to create a file. In the file, create a new file named __init__.py, which is for you to indicate what functions that websites would do. One thing should be notice that *py* stands for python, and we put our python commands here. 

At the very beginning of this file, please add these command lines (from flask import Flask, g, render_template, request) into the __init__.py. 

**Example**

To help you better understand what __init__.py does, we briefly give an example. When we go into a webpage, there's a url link. Same thing to what we do here, whenever there's a new webpage, we need to use **@pp.route('')** to create it by adding a specific thing within a single quotient to represent a url for that webpage. Under this command line, we also need to write a function to specify what it should do in this webpage.

#### - Create a templates file

This file should includes all html files that you would create later.

## 2. Enable Submissions

This is what it should be like for submitting.

![submit1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/submit1.png)



And this is after submitting.

![submit2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/submit2.png)



#### Create submit.html and base.html under the templates folder

First create two html called submit and base in the templates file. And had submit.html extend base.html. The purpose for extension is that we want a website created by base.html navigates users to another website created by submit.html when they click the 'Submit a message' button.

- base.html:

It includes the 'Submit a message' button that with a link refer to submit.html

- submit.html:

There are two parts. One for getting information from users. Another is showing information to users.

#### Write get_message_db()

In this function, we first want to check if there's a messages_db under g attribute. Notice that we need to import sqlite3 here in order to build a connection. If it does not exit, create one. Inside the messages_db, if there's no a messages table, create it with three columns(id: integer, handle: text, message: text) using CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS. Remember to close the connection at the end of the function.

```python
def get_message_db():
    """
    input  : nothing
    output : a database with a message table
    
    Build a connection to the database. And build a table messages 
    with columns(id, handle, and message)
    """
    # check if message_db in g attribute
    if 'message_db' not in g:
        g.message_db = sqlite3.connect('messages_db.sqlite')

    # check if messages exists in message_db
    cmd = \
            """
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages(
                id INTEGER,
                handle TEXT,
                message TEXT);
            """
    cursor = g.message_db.cursor()
    cursor.execute(cmd)
    return g.message_db
```
#### Write insert_message_db(request)

Whatever users input the information, they'll be stored into request.form.

In the function, we want to first run the get_message_db() to check if there exists a table messages, and create one if not. Add three information into the messages table. id is the current row number + 1. And the remaining information is given by users which can be accessed via the request.form. Please run the commit() command after editing the table.

**Note**:

"INSERT INTO table_name ... VALUES ... " might help when insert information into the messages table.

Last thing here is to use render template to tell what to do at POST and GET method. When request.method is 'GET', it calls render_template('submit.html'), which will run the submit.html and there're places for you to fill in the information and submit. When request.method is 'POST', it will first try to run the insert_message(request) and render_template('submit.html', thanks = True, handle = request.form['handle'], message = request.form['message']). If this successes, it will run the remain part of the block content in the submit.html.

```python
def insert_message(request):
    """
    input  : a request form that has user input information
    output : nothing

    Add a new row of data into the messages table by SQL command. 
    Each row contains id, handle, and message. 
    id      : the current row number of table add one.
    handle  : the handle given by user
    message : the message given by user
    """

    # connect the database
    g.message_db = get_message_db()
    cursor = g.message_db.cursor()
    # get the current row number in table messages
    new_cursor = cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM messages;")
    cur_row = new_cursor.fetchall() #current row num
    # modify id
    id = len(cur_row) + 1
    # insert a new row into message table
    cmd = \
        """
        INSERT INTO messages (id, handle, message)
        VALUES ({0}, '{1}', '{2}');
        """.format(id, request.form["handle"], request.form["message"])
    cursor.execute(cmd)
    # run commit to ensure a new row has been saved into messages
    g.message_db.commit()
    g.message_db.close()
```


## 3. Viewing Random Submissions

This is what it should be like when click on View messages button.

![view.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/view.png)


Add another command 'View messages' in the base.html with its reference. Also create a new file 'view.html' in the templates folder.

#### Write random_messages(n)

First create the connection to the messages_db. Next we can use query to get n random messages if possible.

**Note**:

- "SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT ();" might help when get a random row from a table.

- Index and loop is allowed in Jinja tag.

Last thing here is to use render template to tell what to do at POST and GET method.

```python
def random_messages(n):
    """
    input  : an integer n
    output : random n messages from message_db or fewer if n is
    greater than the total messages that the database has.

    return a collection of n random messages if possible
    """
    # connect the database
    g.message_db = get_message_db()
    cursor = g.message_db.cursor()
    cmd = \
    """
    SELECT * FROM messages ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT {0};
    """.format(n)
    cursor.execute(cmd)
    col = cursor.fetchall()
    g.message_db.close()
    return col; 
```

## 4. Customize Your Webapp

Creat a new folder named static. And create a file called style.css, which is for us to customize our webapp.

```python
html { # format for html text
    font-family: cursive;
    background: AntiqueWhite;
    padding: 1rem;
    color: rgb(80, 150, 197);
    font-size: 20px;
}

body { # format for blue parts
    max-width: 900px;
    margin: 0 auto;
}

h1 { # format for text within a h1 tag
    color: rgb(184, 197, 219);
    font-family: monospace;
    margin: 1rem 0;
    text-align: center;
}

a { # format for reference
    font-family: monospace;
    color: rgb(126, 131, 141);
    text-decoration: none;
    font-size: 17px;
}

.content { # format for bule parts
    padding: 0 1rem 1rem;
    background: rgb(214, 235, 241);
    border-radius: 25px;
}

```
